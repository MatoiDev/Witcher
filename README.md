### Witcher - Magical iOS App Switcher
######  Work in progress...

### For testers
If you find a bug, error, or just something not working, then please let me know [here](https://github.com/MatoiDev/Witcher/issues).

Be sure to specify your device model and iOS version. For example:

>###### Rootless/Rootful, iPhone 12, iOS 15.5
>###### Your damn tweak summoned Cthulhu, what am I supposed to do now!?!!

### For developers
Feel free to make pull requests. Any ideas and improvements/refactoring are welcome!

**All contributors will occupy their own cool cell in credits in Witcher's settings** (I'll finish it soon.)
